                        This week - <em>Hacking</em> Finishing up the semester
                        Interested in a lot of projects going forward. Decided to do capstone on emergent behavior,
                        focusing primarily on common stystems like traffic and birds, and extending it to
                        general concepts. Have a lot of other projects I want to work on as well.

                    Very fascinating project, in which a hacker accessed billions of internet routers worldwide.
                    He / she then used the data to create a visualization of the internet, over 24 hours. 
                    Need to read more but is generally astounding.

                <h4 class="chunk-copy">
                    Ideas for digital projects working with paper. One as an extension to the resize
                    project but with paper folding. As you resize the screen it folds paper origami
                    style. Another idea is to make another unity game, basic platformer, but based on white paper.
                    Basically emphasizing the visual style of a shadowbox, and using that as themes for the game. 
                    Another idea was to create some tools for improving internet access. Something to look into more,
                    but generally interested in the social justice considerations of internet access and wondering 
                    if there are any tools I could make to either act as commentary or improve access. Also want 
                    to make a quick student portfolio site.

                    Visually interesting, reminds me of my oil spill project. Presents a procedurally generated logo mark 
                    for a band based on a collection of abstract forms.
