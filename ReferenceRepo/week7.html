                        This Week: <em>Conditional Design, Crowd Sourced Code</em>
                        Jonathan got me stoked and inspired thinking about conditional design in my process.


                        Maddy made a super cool texture experiment. Think about the role textures, and particularly
                        alpha channels, can play in digital illustration. They look cool, especially when in motion.

                    I often struggle with finding the foundational structure behind my coding projects,
                    especially when randomness comes into play. I am drawn to randomness, and to process based work,
                    and have been thinking about ways to ground this randomness and process in the real world.
                    For example, how can the psuedo-random structures of nature inform code? Can the real world 
                    flocking patterns of different types of birds inform the positioning of code elements? 
                    And even better, how can I use the creative variation of people as a way to crowd-source 
                    digital variation?
