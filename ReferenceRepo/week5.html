                    This week - <em>Illustration on The Web</em><br> 
                        I was challenged by Shreyas this week to see how to use illustration on the web
                        in a way that doesn't just display the illustration, but activates it in new ways
                        that can only be achieved through the medium. Also, studios doing risograph but 
                        incorporating digital elements. Also Frank Chimero talking about responsive design.
