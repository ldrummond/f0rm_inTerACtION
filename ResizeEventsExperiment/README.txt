One approach: define the experience as a set of rules

Thoughts: Direction
 1. horizontal - as you scroll, it appears to move horizontally forever
 2. vertical - build variation as you go? vertical but same objects, or vertical and changing objects? 

Idea: Emergent behaviour
    1. Create settings for individual, then see it as a pattern of a whole system

    Ok. then what are the rules? 
    1. what a single element does, all elements must do. 
    2. the user can effect the single without knowing how it will effect the group

    hmm this is different than emergent behaviour...
        like the analogy I talked to grace about, and eddie!

        group behaviours can take two forms (applies to everything from people to experiences)
        - coordinated

Questions:

    1. Difference between these two? 
        - emergent behaviour
        - cellular automata 

    2. What is the opposite of emergent behaviour? (where the whole system depends on relationships, not individuals)
    3. Look up Seagull Flocking and Sparrow Flocking and Cannonballing (Improv / Emergent)


Idea: Layers of Group Behaviour

    STRUCTURAL  
    "choreographed"
        - identical elements    identical actions   (50 identical images doing identical motion)
        - unique elements       identical actions   (50 different dancers doing identical motion)
        - identical elements    unique actions      (50 identical images spun randomly)
        - unique elements       unique actions      (50 dancers improvising separately)


    RELATIONAL  
    "emergent"
        - identical elements    identical relations (Cellular automata)
        - unique elements       identical relations (Flock of birds)
        - identical elements    unique relations    (Genetic / Randomized structures)
        - unique elements       unique relations    (Interactions across groups!!! Unique elements which follow unique rules)
                                                    ^ How does a flock of seagulls interact with a school of fish?!
                                                    ^ Becomes a higher level of elements and relations - relations of two flocks / groups

    HOW DO THESE RELATE?
        1. Layers
            - at different levels of abstraction, different patterns can emerge.
            when put side by side, two groups that might seem STRUCTURAL-IDENTICAL-IDENTICAL
            could become RELATIONAL-UNIQUE-IDENTICAL. 
            ^ How might natural systems that fall in one category actually be subsets of a larger
              different category?
